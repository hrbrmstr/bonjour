Description: Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like
   operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional
   Unicast DNS server. Given a type of service
   that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is
   looking for that service, this mechanism allows clients to discover
   a list of named instances of that desired service, using standard
   DNS queries.  This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service
   Discovery, or DNS-SD. Tools are provided to perform service discovery
   and query for specific services over multicast DNS (mDNS).
